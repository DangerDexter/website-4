Unexpected cracks don't emerge and even if they do, the team is quick to respond.My good wishes are with them and expect them to take the game higher in coming times by experimenting, innovating and leading in newer technologies!",

Since then we have released two highly customized ERP solutions and a subscription based Android app with a subscription management backend. The people at Josh are not just experienced and excellent professionals, but working with them has been an enjoyable experience. They have been able to meet our targets despite strict requirements and tight timelines on all three projects. Due to the highly customized nature of the ERP solutions and the Android app, requirements were often increased in scope or new requirements added as the projects progressed. <wbr>Despite all these, Josh Software delivered and we are more than happy to work with them on upcoming projects.",

    <p>
    A. Very competent & experienced team<br>
    B. Use of efficient, robust & thorough processes/tools like pivotal tracker , github etc<br>
    C. They had worked with a lot of startups across the world with good customer feedback on quality as well as timelines.<br>
    </p>
    <wbr>
    <p>We had a heard a lot of horror stories faced by startups about outsourced tech work so we kept our fingers crossed after they started work , but to our absolute delight Josh has functioned as an extended IT dept of our startup. They are very good at  execution as well as providing suggestions/advice. They have  delivered as per their estimates and forecasts of time and effort .</p>
    I will strongly recommend them for any startup who wants to be lean and efficient.",

<p>    The Josh team consistently delivers nearly flawless, well documented code.  They can quickly understand product requirements, and breakdown development tasks to ensure rapid execution.  The team sets good expectations on delivery timeframes and always meets expectations.  In many urgent situations, Josh managers and developers have gone many extra miles to make a deliverable happen by a key deadline.</p><wbr>

<p>    With regard to technology, the Josh team's knowledge of Ruby, Postgres, Rest APIs, AWS, Regex, web crawling, data management, and systems integration far exceed all other non-US resources and frankly have proven to be much better than many Silicon Valley developers that we have worked with in the past. Along with modern software development stack, Josh team also uses modern development tools including Pivotaltracker, Github and provide detailed status updates to manage the project and keep our executives informed. </p>

<p>    The Josh team takes great pride in their work, takes great care to ensure their clients' success, and we have grown to feel strongly that our Josh team is part of the family in our venture.  We would recommend Josh team for any server side development project and have already referred other entrepreneurs we know to engage them.</p> ",

At multiple times, the team has stood up to the challenges and delivered on aggressive timelines with good quality. The team with different skillsets helps a lot when you can get in a facebook development expert to come in and tweak your fb related code, whereas someone else would actually come in and fix in the rendering issues that are being faced on IE and go back to his regular assighments (which might not be your project). A good focus on writing test cases and automating them helps catch some bugs beforehand. All in all, an awesome, well balanced team. Strongly recommended.",

Hence, the team has deep understanding about the framework and all supplementary libraries from the ecosystem. Another difference, which sets this team apart, is that Josh works more as partner than a service provider. More than once, team has gone extra mile to deliver project on time and on budget. Gautam's relaxed manner of project management worked well with our agile and fast pace of product development. I have found him flexible and accommodating with spec changes and timeline changes. Josh is also leading the Rails interest groups in their community. I am sure the efforts helping them attract best talent and keep themselves up to date with latest from the Rails world.",
